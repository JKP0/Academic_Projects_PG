Following the docs, I tried to run a mrjob on Amazon's EMR. I've tested the job locally using the inline runner,
but it fails when running on Amazon. I've narrowed the failure down to my dependence on an external data file zip_codes.txt.
If I run without that dependency using hardcoded zip code data it works just fine.

I've tried to include the necessary data file using the upload file argument. When I look on S3, the file did make it there,
but clearly something is going wrong so that I cannot access it locally.

Here is my mrjob.conf file:

    aws_secret_access_key: IAMASECRETKEY
